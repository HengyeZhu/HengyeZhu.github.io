I am Hengye Zhu, a contributor of Google Summer of Code Program.

It is a great honor to be selected for the 2025 GSoC_INCF Project 12: Developing Standardised Biophysically Detailed Neuronal Circuit Models Using NeuroML. As I dive into this project, I'll be documenting my experiences, challenges, and learnings here.

Looking forward to an unforgettable summer experience!
