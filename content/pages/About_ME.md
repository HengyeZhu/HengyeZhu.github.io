date: May 23, 2025


I am an undergraduate student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I am interested in Computational Neuroscience and High Performance Computing. My research experience includes developing models and tools for Computational NeuroscienceðŸ§ 

This blog will document my experiences during Google Summer of Code (GSoC). Additionally, I will share knowledge that I find fascinating, such as those in NeuroAI and HPC.
